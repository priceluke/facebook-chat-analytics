# facebook-chat-analytics

It's recommended to use the ipynb file and Google Colab as the code uses Google Drive but it wouldn't take much effort to get it to work with local files if you wanted.

1.   Go to `https://www.facebook.com/dyi/` and request your information. Be sure to save it as JSON and select messenger only to keep file sizes down and allow it to be compatible with this project. 
2.   Then create a folder in your Google Drive and place all the chat files inside.
3.   Run the program and find **Analytics.pptx**
